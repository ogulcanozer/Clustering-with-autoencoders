%After implementing the minimum requirements, if there is enough time, various additional experiments will be performed. First, we will use linear autoencoder with one hidden layer for clustering to compare the performance to clustering with PCA. Then, we will perform the same experiment for non-linear autoencoder and kernel PCA. After the comparisons, we will try methods like Dropout\cite{srivastava2014dropout} and denoising, to prevent one to one mapping and promote generalization\cite{vincent2010stacked}. Finally, we will experiment with ensemble of autoencoders for more robust results.
