# Structure in compressed spaces

### Abstract

In this work, we explore autoencoders with a hidden softmax layer as a clustering method, by training an autoencoder and using the maximum of the output vector as our cluster assignment. 
We also examine traditional clustering algorithms and experiment with feature selection methods to see how they perform compared to each other.
