% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  \graphicspath{ {./images/} }
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else

  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\begin{abstract}
The traditional unsupervised machine learning algorithms like k-Means, PCA and other
linear factor models are proven to be very useful for many important applications.
But in this day and age we are able to collect very complex, high dimensional data
and these simple but efficient algorithms are failing to learn or represent it [1]. In this
work we are going to use auto encoders to reduce the dimensions of three different datasets
and try to extract good features using different activation functions. Then finally, 
we will cluster the data by using the extracted features and compare the results with 
the traditional techniques.

\IEEEPARstart{U}{nsupervised} learning is a branch of machine learning that deals with unlabeled data to find patterns, groups
and relations. This sub section of machine learning is useful to describe and understand unknown data, which 
also helps us understand the properties of future data samples. Right now we are collecting data much faster than we can process it.
And most of the time the data we acquire is unlabeled, and these huge amounts of data are complex, noisy
and it might include unnecessary information.\par There are different ways to reduce the complexity of a given data and learn good 
features from it. In this work, we will look at auto encoders, one of those procedures used to learn features from a given data.
Auto encoders are a part of representational learning, which can be trained with or without labels.
They play a key role in deep learning applications. They are used in dimensionality reduction and feature 
extraction, and together with deep learning they gained a lot of traction after Hinton proposed a method to train 
deep belief networks one layer at a time [2].Another addition to the auto encoder will be the softmax activation function.
Since softmax gives us the probability distribution over-the classes of our data- the output vector [3], we can use the output of our
encoder to train a clustering algorithm. The motivation for using auto encoders is, in what they do they are
very similar to traditional feature selection algorithms, but they are also capable of learning good features from
complex and high dimensional data. This aspect of auto encoders and unsupervised learning in general is important. 
As LeCun states in [3], people are not paying attention to unsupervised learning because of the success of the supervised learning
in recent years. But it will be far more important in the future because of how living beings perceive and learn, they do not
need labels to recognize the world around them.\par In this paper we are going to look at previous work (Section II),
look at different methods and present their results to show how they compare. In Section III, we are going to present 
our goals and what we want to accomplish. Then we will talk about the datasets that we are going to use for the task and 
give detailed information about them. The planned experiments and analyses for the task will be mentioned in Section IV.
Evaluation methods that are going to be used after the experiments will be presented in Section V.

\section{Background}

\section{Methodology}
Our main goal in this study is to correctly cluster data using unsupervised machine learning techniques.
To accomplish this task we will go through three different subtasks. First, we will use traditional clustering algorithms 
to see how they perform on our datasets. In the second part, we will use auto encoders to learn good features
from our datasets, then we will pass the- extracted features- outputs of the auto encoder to a clustering algorithm to see the difference
in their performance. Finally, we will change the output activation function of the auto encoder to the softmax 
activation function, which will give us the probability distribution of the output vector. Then we will use
the maximum weighted class as our cluster assignment.\par
Before starting the experiments the datasets will be examined and processed appropriately for each sub-task.
For the first sub task, depending on the complexity and dimensions of the given data, a suitable clustering algorithm will be chosen.
For the second sub-task, features of the datasets will be standardized. As LeCun concludes in [3], networks
can learn better and faster if the inputs are centered around zero with equalized covariance. Another consideration for sub-tasks
two and three is using ensemble of auto encoders. Since the optimization of the randomly initialized weights is 
difficult [4], we can have multiple auto encoders in our model to mitigate the effects of random weight initialization.
For the last sub-task, since we will be using softmax as our activation function, the targets of our datasets will be 
converted to one hot coded versions.\par

The three datasets chosen to be clustered in this study are Modified NIST, Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (HAR) 
and High Time Resolution Universe Survey 2 (HTRU2).\par

MNIST is a image dataset of hand written digits. It is a modified version of the NIST dataset collected from Census Bureau employees and high-school
students and processed by LeCun et.al..The original NIST set was normalized, so that each sample would be centered
according to the weights of it's pixels in a 28x28 box. Images were also converted to grey-scale and shuffled to make it
easy to use in machine learning applications [5]. The dataset consists of 60.000 training images and 10.000 test images. Since each
sample is represented as a 28x28 pixel binary image, it can be said that samples have 784 features. MNIST dataset is frequently
used in machine learning research[--], which makes it easier for researchers to compare their models and solutions to the others
in the field.\newpage

\caption{Corraletion heatmap of MNIST features.}
\label{fig_mnist}
\end{figure}

HAR is a dataset of multiple classes of human activities. It was created by recording different classes of activities of 30 volunteers
by using the accelerometer and the gyroscope in a smartphone. These sensors were used to record the linear acceleration and angular velocity
on three axes at 50 Hz. Volunteers were also recorded by a camera for the labeling of the activities(walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying)[7]. The dataset consists of 7352
training samples and 2947 test samples. Each sample has 561 features which are- extracted- estimated from the recorded accelerometer and gyroscope signals.These features are normalized, scaled and shifted to be within [-1,1].  Subject id labels for the features and mentioned raw accelerometer and gyroscope signals are also provided with the dataset.
Dimensions of the subject ids are the same with their training and testing parts. On the other hand, the raw signals are seperated into nine different files grouped under three axes, which are body acceleration (X,Y,Z), body gyroscope (X,Y,Z) and total acceleratin (X,Y,Z).

  \end{figure}
  \par
  
  Our last dataset HTRU2 was obtained by Bates[] using ANNs to first filter out the bad candidates,then manually inspecting the outputs of the ANN.Each sample of HTRU2 is a set of features extracted from the data acquired by large radio telescopes during High Time Resolution Universe Survey. HTRU2 has 8 features and consists of 17,898 total samples. Only 1,639 of them are positive pulsar samples and the 16,259 of them are negative samples. The first four features are simple statistics of the pulsar profiles and rest of the features were obtained from DM-SNR curve [].These compact features were obtained from 90.000 labeled pulsar candidates by using Pulsar Feature Lab [].

\section{Experiments}

In the experiments the implementation of the tasks and data analysis will be done using python. In the imlementation of the traditional clustering algorithms, sckit-learn library will be used because of its easy to use nature and rich functions. For the rest of the tasks, tensorflow and keras libraries will be used to implement auto encoders, Since tensorflow converts the python code into C code in runtime, it is fast and it can run on GPUs, making it one of the best neural network library. Finally, the data analysis and plotting will be done using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

\subsection{Clustering Algorithms}
In the core part of the clustering experiments, k-Means and DBSCAN algorithms will be used. These algorithms will be first compared to each other, then their results will be analysed, evaluated and recorded for future comparisons. If there is enough time to deviate from the core path,agglomerative clustering algorithm will also be used and these clustering algorithms will be tested again after applying dimensionality reduction methods like PCA/kernel PCA, LDA to the datasets. Otherwise, the experiments will continue with the auto encoders.  

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% \begin{figure*}[!t]
% \centering
% \subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%

% \subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
% \label{fig_second_case}}
% \caption{Simulation results for the network.}
% \label{fig_sim}
% \end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%


\appendices
\section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}
Appendix one text goes here.

% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank
\section{}
Appendix two text goes here.


% use section* for acknowledgment
\section*{Acknowledgment}


The authors would like to thank...


% Can use something like this to put references on a page
% by themselves when using endfloat and the captionsoff option.
\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
  \newpage
\fi



% trigger a \newpage just before the given reference
% number - used to balance the columns on the last page
% adjust value as needed - may need to be readjusted if
% the document is modified later
%\IEEEtriggeratref{8}
% The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:
%\IEEEtriggercmd{\enlargethispage{-5in}}

% references section

% can use a bibliography generated by BibTeX as a .bbl file

% biography section

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
